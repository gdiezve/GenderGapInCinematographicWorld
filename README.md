# Gender Gap in Cinematographic World

I started this project because I wanted to check how big is the gender gap in cinematographic world, and if there were any variables that affected this difference.

I obtained the data scrapping the FilmAffinity web; as my main purpose was to check gender bias, I used the Gendeize.io API to obtain the gender from the first names of my cast and directors.

After that I started working with a total number of 2383 movies and TV shows, analysing them in three different ways: a first Exploratory Data Analysis, a NLP analysis from the reviews and a Computer Vision analysis from the covers.
