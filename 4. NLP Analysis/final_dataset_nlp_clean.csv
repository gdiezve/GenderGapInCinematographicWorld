0,Money Heist,"""[4th Season Review]: [It] is like an extended heist movie except it gets pacier with every episode (…) Rating: ★★★★★ (out of 5)"" , ""[4th Season Review]: [It] is peerless escapism. But ennui is setting in"" , ""[4th Season Review]: [It] gets off to a pretty good start although the slower pace and more confined spaces our characters find themselves in lacks some of the early season tension felt last time out (…) Rating: ★★★½ (out of 5)"" , ""MONEY HEIST, aka CASA DE PAPEL: The current season [S3] tops the first one. It's exciting and hilarious."" , ""[2nd Season Review]: If you want a thriller with visual panache — like freaky Dalí masks — try this. —"" , ""[2nd Season Review]: [It] continues to thrive thanks to its ensemble cast. It’s wildly suspenseful, addictive, and at times, infuriating, but those are all the makings for the best kind of heist thriller."" , ""You won't be disappointed. The intrigue, wit and humor of the colorful characters, the action, suspense and inventive storyline will keep you glued to the screen."" , ""None of the essentially claustrophobic atmosphere has been shed: it’s still a glorious 'Peaky Blinders', just with tapas and subtitles."" ",Men,Men
1,The Blacklist,"""His name is above the title and, depending how you feel about James Spader, NBC’s 'The Blacklist' may become your favorite fall show."" , ""The pilot episode is stylish and swiftly paced, but that’s all it is, and despite some intriguing plot twists, there’s not a lot of motivation to keep coming back."" , ""It’s certainly an intriguing pilot--you can’t take your eyes off of Spader and the writers have thrown in a couple of other interesting twists."" , ""Spader has always been a particularly interesting actor, and he’s well suited to this sort of twisted figure, where so much is going on behind those eyes."" , ""You think you know this situation and how it will turn out, but there are surprise, yet entirely credible, twists."" , ""The many layers of feints and puzzles are compelling, but it’s hard to see how they can last more than a season or two."" ",Men,Men
2,Prison Break,"""A strong cast led by Wentworth Miller (...) It needs to begin peeling away the layers more quickly"" , ""For all its constraints, the series is as suspenseful and addictive as '24' or Showtime's 'Sleeper Cell'."" , ""If the show can stay as gripping as its premiere, though, it will be a welcome new prime-time puzzle"" , ""'Prison Break' doesn't disappoint (...) I've seen the first three hours of 'Prison Break'. Each one flew by quickly, and I'm quite keen to see the fourth."" , ""It works as a two-hour premiere special, one that grabs your attention from its first scene to its startling cliffhanger ending (…) Rating: ★★★ (out of 4)"" , ""High concept TV doesn't get more fun than 'Prison Break' (...) It surely cannot get more nail-bitingly clever than this (…) Rating: ★★★★ (out of 5)"" , ""Plots don't come any dafter than this – 'Prison Break' is trash genius and the tension leaves me literally squawking with stress"" ",Men,Men
3,13 Reasons Why,"""[2nd Season Review]: [It] is a frustratingly unnecessary mess (...) Unfortunately, the season's execution is frequently dismal."" , ""[2nd Season Review]: It’s still captivating viewing (...) The show doesn’t offer solutions, but it does offer empathy. And sometimes, that’s exactly what’s needed."" , ""[2nd Season Review]: [It] is even more insufferable in Season 2 (...) A tawdry, unnecessary exercise (...) There are zero reasons to put yourself through it (…) Rating: ★ (out of 4)"" , ""[2nd Season Review]: The show has sacrificed the momentum associated with season one's structure (...) The flashbacks work notably better than the present-day material"" , ""[2nd Season Review]: A satisfying, self-aware season 2 (...) The writers accurately capture the center-of-my-own-universe angst of the teen mind"" , ""[2nd Season Review]: The strengths (...) remain the same, while the weaknesses (...) have failed to resolve themselves (...) Minnette is a marvel"" , ""'13 Reasons Why' is undoubtedly sincere, but it’s also, in many important ways, creatively successful"" , ""The drama is sensitive, surprising, consistently engaging, and, most important, unblinking."" , ""[It] tackles its touchy subject in a thoughtful and interesting way"" , ""A frank, authentically affecting portrait of what it feels like to be young, lost, and too fragile for the world."" , ""An insistently intense dramatization of teenage suicide (...) makes its point in spite of a gimmicky narrative structure and widespread character inconsistencies"" , ""It presents a compelling vision of the teenage experience, reminiscent of Sofia Coppola’s 'The Virgin Suicides' (...) Langford is outstanding."" ",Men,Men
4,Dark,"""[2nd Season Review]: 'Dark' has lofty narrative ambitions, and it continues to nail them at every twist and turn (...) Everything viewers loved about the German series in Season 1 is still there in Season 2"" , ""[2nd Season Review]: [It] is defiantly bizarre, twisty, and more addictive than ever (...) It does offer an existential playground that few other shows dare venture into"" , [2nd Season Review]: Baran bo Odar and Jantje Friese reward your patience with some stellar WTF moments (...) A tightly-woven tapestry of compelling stories and memorable performances"" , ""[2nd Season Review]: [It has] a knack for turning complexity and mystery into satisfying storytelling (...) [It] maintains an overall sense of mystery without becoming ponderous, plodding, or repetitive."" , ""[2nd Season Review]: Deliciously creepy (...) 'Dark', with its absolute sincerity and lush production, is a luxurious myth (…) Rating: ★★★★ (out of 5)"" , ""'Dark' hits all of the finer points that helped propel series like 'The OA' and 'Stranger Things' to atmospheric success"" , ""[It] is far spookier than 'Stranger Things' (...) 'Dark's storyline manages to be at once simple and mind-bending (…) Rating: ★★★★ (out of 5)"" , ""Through five of its first 10 episodes, 'Dark' is tremendously successful at making me unsure of what's going on and how its world is operating — and largely unsuccessful at making me care beyond that."" , ""The point of a story like this is where it takes you, and this does take you somewhere rich and strange. As familiar as its elements may be, its pleasures are particular and many."" , ""If you’re willing to buy into 'Dark's puzzle, the rewards will be great"" , ""After that promising teaser, 'Dark' becomes terribly familiar (...) Watching 'Dark', you might be left with the idea that there are no new ideas. Only remakes and reruns."" ",Men,Men
5,Riverdale,"""That 'Riverdale' is contradictory is part of its charm (...) Although I can list questions I don't need answers to and relationships I'm not invested in, 'Riverdale' is all-in on its gimmick, and I can admire that."" , ""'Riverdale', the CW’s new teen drama based on the 'Archie' comics, is an eerie and offbeat take on the high school mythos--both addictive and confusing in equal parts."" , ""If the tone is not yet consistent, the aesthetic is, a strong sign that 'Riverdale' knows what it wants to be. The terrific art direction warps the bubble-gum iconography into something haunting and lurid."" , ""A darker, more realistic 'Archie' universe (...) This is the best young adult cast for any drama in years."" , ""A twisted but often satisfying alternative spin on the Archieverse."" ",Men,Men
6,Lucifer,"""'Lucifer' certainly has a sense of atmosphere, and has some fun with little touches (...) Still, it’s  (...) a slightly sulfurous version of 'Bones' or (...) 'Rosewood'."" , ""The conventional crime-time format incinerates everything strange and spirited about the concept."" , ""There’s nice but predictable chemistry between Ellis and German (...) the show’s concept is so obvious, it’s easy to see exactly where this will go, unless it gets canceled first."" , ""'Lucifer' arrives with all of the superficial flash you'd expect from a Len Wiseman-directed pilot. But (...) this new drama doesn't begin to show sparks of interest until at least the fifth episode."" , ""Mr. Ellis was born in Wales, and the creators of this incoherent mess apparently hope that his accent will convey rakishness and arch sophistication. Instead you just want to wipe the perpetual smirk off his face."" ",Men,Men
7,Peaky Blinders,"""[5th Season Review]: Good news (...) the formula is the same. (…) Rating: ★★★ (out of 5)"" , ""[5th Season Review]: It still punches hard, offering big payoffs and even bigger revelations."" , ""[5th Season Review]: It is refreshing (...) to see that even in its fifth season, the series can still ratchet up the tension and put the squeeze on its unlawful family in such a confident and entertaining way."" , ""[5th Season Review]: A heady, chaotic series, with multiplying plotlines and more enemies than we could count"" , ""[5th Season Review]: Visually stunning and crammed full of compelling performances."" , ""[4th Season Review]: Lovingly shot, impeccably dressed (set and costume) and manages to convey a serious amount of plot information without the dialogue ever feeling clunky or expository."" , ""[4th Season Review]: Ferocious and fantastic (...) 'Peaky' is always reaching for something bigger and better (...) A stunning series opener"" , ""[4th Season Review]: As Michael added (...) 'We’re not the Peaky Blinders unless we’re together'. A thrilling way to reboot the action, reunite the gang and set up the new series."" , ""[2nd Season Review]: This second series, more confident and wider in scope, eclipsed the first. (...) Rating: ★★★★ (out of five)"" , ""'Peaky Blinders' is literate (...) and sometimes great looking (...) But for a sprawling soap opera (...) it doesn’t have quite enough juice."" , ""It’s a respectable but chilly effort."" , ""'Peaky Blinders' is laudable for its ambition alone, all too rare in primetime drama. The pace, too, is breathtaking. While this occasionally leads to some clunky exposition, the powerful performances excuse everything."" ",Men,Men
8,Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,"""It’s a worthwhile piece of work, if a painful watch."" , ""Powerful tale of sexual predation, legal failure and ruined lives (…) Rating: ★★★★ (out of 5)"" , ""Epstein’s story is disturbing, horrifying, and also fascinating (...) 'Filthy Rich' does an excellent job of laying out all the details, painting a disturbing portrait of Epstein’s world"" , ""A four-part doc that's eye-opening at certain points and self-protectively myopic at others"" , ""Your level of engagement with the series will depend on how much stomach you have for hearing about Epstein’s crimes and abuses of power"" , ""What the Netflix docu-series accomplishes most effectively is to capture the helplessness that survivors of Epstein's abuse say they felt."" , ""Middling Netflix docuseries is a waste of time (...) This mediocre series dishonors survivors of his abuse."" , ""We listen, and we empathize (...) There's a bigger, broader story to be told about Epstein (...) For now, 'Filthy Rich' is a good start."" , ""Their testimonies are heartbreaking, and every single one of them is brave to go on camera (...) However, their courage alone doesn’t shape 'Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich' into an accomplished documentary (…) Rating: ★★ (out of 4)"" , ""A must-watch docuseries, highlighting the evil, the errors of the system, and the horrifying stories of the victims (…) Rating: ★★★★ (out of 5)"" ",Men,Women
9,Snowpiercer,"""The result is watchable, but not much more (...) It’s revealing how little, and rarely, “Snowpiercer” really feels set on a train. One never senses the jostling movement of wheels over tracks:"" , ""[It] has lost track of what made the film so special (...) It's a clearly inferior version of something that was already great and never needed to be revisited again (…) Rating: ★★ (out of 5)"" , ""The more additions Manson and co. make to 'Snowpiercer's architecture and world-building, the more ungainly that world becomes"" , ""[A] tonally uneven, narratively confusing TV adaptation (...) A mess, full of half-developed characters, illogical plot choices and incompletely realized social satire"" , ""For about four episodes, 'Snowpiercer' veers way too close to becoming a TNT police procedural (...) As a season of escapist adventure, you could do far worse"" , ""A frustrating exercise in adaptation (...) While 'Snowpiercer' is not necessarily unwatchable, but it’s certainly not easy to remain engaged from episode to episode"" , ""Despite its minor lapses, though, 'Snowpiercer' is both a diverting and, as it happens, timely entertainment (…) Rating: ★★★★ (out of 5)"" , ""'SNOWPIERCER' is a harmless summer television series and one that pales in the shadow of the acclaimed feature film that preceded it."" ",Women,Men
10,Breaking Bad,"""A mondo-bizarro, dark-as-midnight, bitterly bleak tragicomedy (...) 'Breaking Bad' may give you an oddly gratifying case of the creeps"" , ""Breaking Bad mixes desperation and deviousness to yield a volatile, valuable product"" , ""It’s the pacing that makes 'Breaking Bad' more of a hard slog than a cautionary joy ride. It has good acting"" , ""Series creator Vince Gilligan brings a quirky sensibility to the pilot, and the show grows increasingly rich and absorbing in the second and third hours"" , 
                    ""It's an uneven Coen Brothers--like mix of dark comedy and darker moral drama, but Cranston is amazing as a desperate, conflicted gangsta-nerd""                , ""[A pilot] that is suspenseful and surprising. Cranston is always fun to watch, and 'Bad' is no exception."" , ""Walt is the perfect anti-hero. Thanks in no small part to Cranston’s diamond-edged charm (...) It is fascinating, really (…) Rating: ★★★★★ (out of 5)"" , ""[It] is very well done, but it has a bleakness that seems to be manufactured for no good reason"" , ""Its achievement rarely matches its ambitions, but the effect is still pretty dope."" , ""It's rough, it's ugly, and it's sometimes nauseating. I can't wait to see more."" ",Men,Men
11,White Lines,"""A proper mystery, party island excess, and a stellar creative pedigree all combine to make 'White Lines' (Netflix) your binge of the weekend (…) Rating: ★★★½ (out of 5)"" , ""The drama has everything to keep viewers invested, turned on, and watching, potentially even in one sitting. It’s a fun, steamy escape"" , ""A genre-bending, raucous and downright bananas ride, and one that you won't want to get off in a hurry. (...) Don't try to take it too seriously."" , ""There are moments of brilliance that are utterly thrilling, but they always seem to dissipate prematurely, leaving something that never quite hits the mark.(...) Rating: ★★★ (out of 5)"" , ""[An] irreverent, brash, kinetic new 10-part crime drama-cum-caper (...) I’d be surprised if this lurid, swirling, fantastically confident creation didn’t hit the spot (...) Rating: ★★★★ (out of 5)"" , ""A worthwhile trip if you ignore its flaws (...) It might not be the best drama series you'll ever see, but if you tuned into 'The Stranger' on Netflix recently, this will probably be your next big binge"" , ""It’s bad TV, but nails the glorious nonsense of Ibiza. (...) The dance scenes can be excruciating (lots of waving arms) and the dialogue frequently woeful."" , ""Fancy a 10-hour break in Ibiza full of sex, drugs, raves and murder? (...) is a glamorous, violent, sexy, and colourful thriller with a great lead turn (...) Rating: ★★★★ (out of 5)"" ",Men,Men
12,Narcos,"""[3rd Season Review]: Pascal lends the series the continuity it needs, both in tone and context (...) The elements that made 'Narcos' so compelling in its first two seasons are all here (…) Rating: ★★★ (out of 4)"" , ""[3rd Season Review]: The drug war might be lost, but the best version of this show is found (...) Season 3 continues that journey with an investment in human storytelling."" , ""[3rd Season Review]: After watching six of the new season's 10 episodes, I was reasonably hooked and eager to see the rest of them (...) Stick with the show through the place-setting opening and know that it finds its footing."" , ""[3rd Season Review]: The array of characters is particularly strong (...) 'Narcos' remains tense -- almost unbearably so at times -- bleak and disturbing (...) [It delivers] the same high."" , ""[3rd Season Review]: Salcedo becomes the show’s stealth star and the main reason you stay on the couch watching every time the next episode automatically spins up."" , ""[3rd Season Review]: 'Narcos' uses the downfall of the Cali syndicate in the late 1990s to rectify some of the first and second season's more significant flaws (...) It’s still signature 'Narcos'."" , ""[2nd Season Review]: The second season of Netflix's gripping true-life crime thriller 'Narcos' proves once again that real life is more bizarre than fiction."" , ""[2nd Season Review]: Allow yourself to be mesmerized and appalled at one of the most outrageous true crime dramas ever filmed. (...) Rating: ★★★ (out of four)"" , ""[2nd Season Review]: 'Narcos' provokes us to question media representations of villainy, fictional and otherwise, and challenges us to wrestle with Escobar's humanity and evil."" , ""[2nd Season Review]: Season 2 requires more attentive viewing than Season 1 did — there are more players, alliances and animosities to track — but it also gives the writers characters other than Escobar to develop."" , ""Functioning as a history lesson as well as a compelling drama, “Narcos” has a “Goodfellas” vibe,  inasmuch as it offers a heavily narrated, first-person account of the rise of a drug kingpin (...) a taut, gripping narrative (....) Unlike most series, “Narcos” isn’t about the players, but the game."" , ""Not since Walter White and Jesse Pinkman's last batch of blue crystal meth has Netflix offered up a crime and drugs drama quite this addictive."" , ""The world doesn’t seem to lack for Pablo Escobar biopics (...) Narcos separates itself from the pack with an impressive breadth and depth. (...) Narcos smartly concerns itself with telling the story from a number of perspectives, but with an overriding care to never depict Americans as the heroes"" , ""Get hooked on Netflix’s compelling drug war saga (...) Moura is especially compelling as he manipulates the seeming incongruities of Escobar’s character to heighten his aura of unpredictable menace"" , ""Electrifying (...) Escobar remains inscrutable (...) But “Narcos” is nevertheless addictive, compelling, shocking, and even educational."" , ""An irresistible drama (...) A prize-worthy performance by the Brazilian actor Wagner Moura"" , ""Realistic look at 1990s drug lord Pablo Escobar and his pursuer on Netflix (...) One of the strengths of Narcos is its refusal to paint anyone as purely good or bad. (...) Rating: ★★★ (out of five) ",Men,Men
13,Toy Boy,"""Stream it, if you’re in the mood for some Spanish camp and soapy striptease action, but do not feel any shame about fast-forwarding."" ",Men,Men
14,Arrow,"""Granted, it's all standard superhero stuff. But the action scenes are well-handled, the emotions and the characters mostly ring true, and the plot offers enough twists to keep you intrigued (...) Rating: ★★½ (out of 4)"" , ""'Arrow' certainly looks polished, but there's only so much action an hourlong drama can afford, and the characters necessary to sustain the series are, initially, strictly two-dimensional"" , ""Your interest in 'Arrow' depends on how much you miss the troubled-in-love, conflicted-by-family heroics of 'Smallville'--it mirrors that series' setup"" ",Men,Men
15,Ozark,"""[3rd Season Review]: [It] raises the stakes like never before, with characters transforming to new heights and a time bomb lurking from underneath (…) Rating: ★★★★½ (out of 5)"" , ""[3rd Season Review]: [It] manages to maintain the level of tension this show is known for while adding a layer of emotional stakes in the form of Marty and Wendy’s fractured relationship (…) Rating: ★★★ (out of 5)"" , ""[3rd Season Review]: A much better organized and, thankfully, more streamlined new season (...) There’s still plenty of bloat to go around, though thankfully nowhere near as much as in season 2 (…) Rating: ★★★★ (out of 5)"" , ""[3rd Season Review]: [It's] a marked improvement over Season 2, dialing up the pressure and tossing in just enough surprises to keep the audience on their toes."" , ""[3rd Season Review]: It’s still a gripping show, it just does a dumb thing (...) A frustrating new character causes trouble, but Laura Linney saves the day."" , ""[3rd Season Review]: It's still by far the most stressful and emotionally ravaging stretch of the show (…) Rating: ★★★ (out of 5)"" , ""[3rd Season Review]: A gripping season (...) 'Ozark' demonstrates a welcome willingness to mess with its own status quo"" , ""[3rd Season Review]: Linney shines in a much-improved third season."" , ""[3rd Season Review]: [It] mostly feels like more of the same, but a couple of characters create fresh tension (…) Rating: ★★★ (out of 5)"" , ""[2nd Season Review]: 'Ozark' hums on, riding that wave of pure competence (...) [Marty and Wendy] have nowhere to go as characters (...) Characters who feel unrewardingly flat"" , ""[2nd Season Review]: A darker, stronger second season (...) [It] tells a completely captivating story from start to finish"" , ""[2nd Season Review]: A sturdy but bland follow-up (...) [It] can't keep the momentum that made Season 1 so thrilling."" , ""[2nd Season Review]: Gloomy, monotonous and poorly focused (...) 10 dreary, bloated episodes."" , ""[2nd Season Review]: The show’s second season not only settles into its own unique groove, it digs deeper into what makes a 'bad person' through exceptional character work (…) Rating: ★★★ (out of 5)"" , ""[2nd Season Review]: On the whole, this is a very enjoyable season of television. A definite page-turner (...) and one that goes to some incredibly dark places"" , ""The series regularly finds a way to highlight the humanity in a story of inhuman acts, and knows when to turn away from an act too vile to witness."" , ""Ozark is smart, well-crafted, and says something."" , ""Enough is happening in 'Ozark' that it's never boring, which sets it apart from Netflix's recent misguided stab at prestige programming, 'Gypsy'. Instead of being predictable, though, 'Ozark' becomes monotonous."" , ""In 'Ozark', a lot happens, but not much is going on (...) Your comfort level will be enhanced by the arty, muted cinematography."" , ""Jason Bateman shines (...) [It] starts with a familiar premise (...) but becomes increasingly engrossing"" , ""A masterstroke for Jason Bateman (...) Bateman’s commanding performance powers a gripping, twisty, sometimes spotty yarn that plays like 'Breaking Bad' in reverse"" , ""'Ozark' repeatedly overturns dramatic cliches (...) but it’s always convincing. Linney is, as ever, magnificent. And the Lake of the Ozarks, where the deep water is never far from shore, is a gift."" , ""Clichés aside, this is a deeply gripping drama (...) The saving grace is the tightly sprung plot (…) Rating: ★★★★ (out of 5)"" ",Men,Men
16,How to Get Away With Murder,"""It’s straining to be TV’s new obsession, instead of a riveting drama."" , ""[A] Rhimes-style melodrama and pace (...) might be stretching things too far, but even a schlock skeptic has to admire the ease with which 'Murder' intuits its audience’s need for speed and surprises."" , ""While it’s so fast paced, you barely realize that it isn’t always credible, you do get that it’s always fun."" , ""The show would benefit from easing up on the frenetic pace, taking a breath every now and then, and making its younger cast members seem like they’re actually in law school, not an Abercrombie & Fitch catalog. (...) Rating: ★★½ (out of four)"" , ""A few minutes in, and you can sense a promise of sex, surprises, and a healthy dose of fun. And so far, the show delivers. (...) Rating: ★★★ (out of four)"" ",Men,Men
17,Sons of Anarchy,"""'Sons' has plenty of guns and violence, but it prefers to find its drama in the dialogue, in the internal struggles of the characters (...) Few series have exploded onto the scene with such a rich array of potential stories"" , ""A ""Sopranos"" for the new century (...) Every character is unique (...) Rating: ★★★½"" , ""'Sons of Anarchy' may be wild fantasy and melodrama, but it is tempered by a feeling of verity."" , ""Certainly, the show is still exciting and thoughtful in the way that it disassembles many pat notions we may have of tribe loyalty, family bonds, and the treachery of the business world."" , ""The series remains an immersive experience, and the cast has been gradually upgraded."" ",Men,Men
18,The Sinner,"""A fantastic summer mystery series (...) The set-up is wonderfully simple in mystery terms (...) There’s so much to like here that any missteps are quickly forgotten."" , ""Given this, Biel’s committed, evocative turn, and the sure-handed direction of Antonio Campos ('Christine'), our interest is piqued enough to dig deeper."" , ""[It] tries for something unique, a whydunit instead of a whodunit that deconstructs ideas about good, evil, and identity (...) But it’s as fun as a trip to a confessional booth and doesn’t achieve the transcendence it covets."" , ""It is a pleasure to watch (...) It all adds up to a drama that's strikingly filmed, gratifyingly smarter than it needs to be and (...) snappily paced."" , ""'The Sinner' achieves its goal of piquing your curiosity (...) There’s something about the way the mystery unfolds on 'Sinner' that feels particularly seedy (…) Rating: ★★ (out of 4)"" , ""The first three episodes (...) are sufficiently intriguing and stylish to make the wait worthwhile, as long as you accept the possibility of disappointment when all the secrets are revealed."" , ""[Biel] gives a committed performance, measured even in its required extremes (...) 'The Sinner' does present a puzzle; it has a certain gravitational pull."" , ""The set-up for 'The Sinner' (...) is instantly gripping and provocative (...) Regardless of mini-howlers here and there, we’re as curious as Ambrose to know who Cora really is and what happened to her in the past"" ",Women,Men
19,Queen of the South,"""In short, a lot of stuff happens (...) too much to be believed, but the character of Teresa and Braga's performance are enough to pique our interest."" , ""The premiere is wild ride through a fun house of exposition, crazy escapes and scenario set-ups."" , ""[It] is far from the best modern TV has to offer. But for all its amped up aesthetics, I'm not sure it even wants to be part of the club"" , ""There's nothing that sets it apart from, well, most shows, and any attempt to break out of the typical drama structure comes off as forced and unnecessary."" ",Men,Men

It’s grim, but honest"" , ""The series remains as addictive as ever in chronicling the bleak history of the drug war, delivering a drama so crisp and smartly executed as to provide its own kind of high."" , ""[It] tells its story with as much flair as a GCSE history book (...) [It] lives in the shadow of its predecessors, attempting to emulate their success without any willingness to embrace originality (…) Rating: ★★ (out of 5)"" , ""[It] has successfully excavated the human drama from the [historical] record, and in doing so has constructed a narrative that’s as fascinating in its character beats as it is in how it delivers a chronicle of real-life events."" ",Men,Men

Through five episodes, though, it’s a slick ride so far (…) Rating: ★★★ (out of 5)"" , ""A stalker's point-of-view drives this clever and twisty series (...) It’s all too easy to get hooked."" ",Men,Women
22,El Chapo,"""The Netflix show can’t discern between the gravity of fact and the thrill of fiction (...)

An excellent, charismatic set of leads who embody the characters well"" , ""Some fans may be drawn to the blood and viscera, but the series is strong enough to succeed without pushing those boundaries."" , ""Visually, 'Titans' aesthetic ranges from unappealing to shockingly cheap (...) 'Titans' biggest failing—and biggest missed opportunity—is that it’s not any fun (…) Rating: ★ (out of 5)"" , ""The production design looks cheap, the fight scenes (...) perfunctory and forgettable, and Starfire is the only lead character in the initial episodes to make much of an impression at all (…) Rating: ★ (out of 5)"" , ""The one thing likely to hook most viewers in — and keep them hooked — is the overarching mystery that pulls all our players together, giving us and them few answers, but quite a few chilling questions"" ",Men,Men
25,Designated Survivor,"""The pilot is tremendous. It’s tightly plotted, and, despite being about terrorism like '24', it brings Sutherland out of the shadow of can-do Jack Bauer."" , ""It's annoying how good 'Designated Survivor' is. Annoying, because the topic is so ridiculously cheesy, and the emotions so deliberately over-the-top. And yet the concept is immediately engrossing, and the execution nearly seamless."" , ""Kiefer Sutherland ('24') makes a welcome return in this intriguing mix of conspiracy thriller and political drama."" , ""The execution of this premise (...) is taut, fast-moving and reasonably believable (...)

There's no villain, but there's also no comic relief or voice of wise authority and well-delivered exposition."" , ""Blandness is 'Iron Fist’s greatest enemy (...) Filler episodes are one thing, but right now 'Iron Fist' looks like a filler season."" , ""The new Netflix binge swings and misses so bad that it spins itself around and slaps itself silly with a weirdly flaccid hand.

And like its predecessor, 'Better Call Saul' raises more questions (...) than it will readily answer."" , ""I was skeptical of the idea (...) yet after three episodes, I have to say it’s… pretty good"" , ""Like Saul himself, its identity is a work in progress. The energetic visual storytelling engages, but the deliberate pacing left me restless."" , ""Essentially, 'Saul' is an extended origin story, possessing 'Bad’s' flavor and black comedy but at least initially lacking its emotional core. While that dictates a mixed verdict, the creative auspices nevertheless bode well."" , ""The first hour moves slower than people might be expecting, but builds to and ends on a wonderful cliff-hanger that is partly but not fully solved in the second episode."" , ""'Better Call Saul' is better than good: It’s delightful--in a brutal, darkly comic way, of course."" , ""We already know where he ends up, but it sure is fun watching him get dirty along the way.

Fincher's proven time and again that he can make even the most mundane activities and actions riveting."" , ""Although scenes are strung together a bit casually, they are lavishly filmed, meticulously directed and scored. Groff and McCallany are well-cast (...) But overall, the series lacks sharpness. (...) Rating: ★★½ (out of 4)"" , ""'Mindhunter' (...) is more academic than sensationalistic (...) Still, the series’ linking of irrational times and unspeakable acts resonates with today’s stories of mass shootings."" , ""While 'Mindhunter' is yet another serial killer drama, it's one with an intriguing angle. The emphasis isn't on finding a killer; it's on institutional reform."" , ""At its best, the genre tries to understand the roots of crime by investigating some of humanity’s most vexing paradoxes. 'Mindhunter', curious and thoughtful, is an example of the latter."" , ""The first two episodes are immaculately shot (...) and the dialogue falls somewhere between Sorkin and Hemingway in that it's smart but terse."" , ""Occasionally flat, sporadically gruesome, 'Mindhunter' is also potentially absorbing."" , ""The direction's probably a little more functional than his feature work, but David Fincher being functional is still anyone else at the top of their game."" ",Men,Men

227,The Mist,"The best thing about ""The Fog"", in my case, is that so much whiteness helped me to see that my television screen was very dusty.

                    Pure adventure without subtlety or metaphors, ""The Revenant"" invokes the primary instincts, not the intellect. It should be noted, and remember that violence in cinema ""is always fiction"" before entering this great sensory -and visceral- experience, the last paradigm of how human and digital art join forces in search of our attention.

If last year Iñárritu reminded us of the spiritual meaning of living - in reality and in the cinema - a time of empty superheroes (which is what 'Birdman' was intended to be), the director now delivers another harsh portrait of the man. The brand of the Mexican's house, the merciless nature and all his beings, now based on real events. A cinephile claw to the shoddy blockbusters.

""The Revenant"" may not be a complex emotional odyssey, but it is a very powerful story about survival that drags you through the coldest and wildest North America pulling at your insides. It is raw and unforgiving like the earth without god or mercy that it treads. It is also a small ode to parenthood and to the refuge of civilization of unbeatable beauty and appalling seriousness.

Like the immense DiCaprio, rest while you can in the scenes-tribute to the most poetic Terrence Malick: when the brutal sequences of a realism close to the unheard of arrive, you will not be prepared. It is also paradoxical that, after a shoot in the middle of nature, with a great cast delivered in the midst of imposing landscapes, what is engraved on the retina are the visual effects of a technical team of geniuses beyond praise.

Digitized hyperreality has here some of the top scenes in its field. Of course, not suitable for everyone. They will also accuse her of harsh and bombastic. But just as some will reject it, others will love it. The proposal is simple: a ""Jeremiah Johnson"" of the 21st century incubated in the mind of a guy from Mexico City, without the pricks of Hollywood. Just do not expect transcendence this time, let yourself go and a visual storm of paroxysm and weather will shake you until you stamp them against amazement. , ""A beautiful work of art, from a filmmaker who demands perfection from himself.

372,Mystic River,"Mystic River offers, as few times in the cinema of recent years, a story in which the thriller and drama melt astonishingly before a viewer who is trapped by both the evolution of the characters and the intrigue of the story. There were few occasions when an American thriller was lately accompanied by a complex tragedy that delves deep into trauma, justice and the senses of life. But a couple of details, in my opinion, prevent it from being an absolute masterpiece (two aspects that make it necessary to REVEAL KEY DETAILS OF THE FILM - SPOILER): the first, that the writer (and I suppose that the novel) uses a The same idea twice: the one that originates the intrigue (and on which the suspense is maintained) is again used to clarify it. The matter is not unimportant, since the entire plot is based on one key: the simultaneity, the coincidence of 2 events that occur at the same time. And here are two, no less. One causes intrigue. The other resolves it tragically. And whoever writes this believes that the first simultaneity (the murders) is a brilliant idea. The second (the arrests and the ""execution"") ... is too much of a coincidence. The other debatable question is whether the role of women is well defined in the script: Tim Robbins' wife inexplicably does not ask for any kind of justice or explanation. The one by Kevin Bacon -from the phone- does not provide anything relevant except a gram of final happiness. And the character of the fantastic Laura Linney - Penn's wife -, inconsequential for two hours, suddenly is defined for us a few minutes from the end with a vehement speech that leaves you nailed to the armchair.

420,The Remains of the Day,"James Ivory's masterful melodrama, enhanced by superb performances and staging. Almost perfect, it is undoubtedly the best of the collaborations (mostly period dramas) that, over several decades, delivered the tandem formed by the British director, producer Ismail Merchant and screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala.

546,Kill Bill: Vol. 1,"Whoever wants to take out his katana but, in my opinion, ""Kill Bill"" has the worst of Tarantino and almost nothing of the good of this great director. All the characters are flat, empty and gimmicky, surprising when the talented Quentin composed in his three previous films characters as unforgettable as they are complex. Just because ""Kill Bill"" is a tribute to Asian action movies doesn't mean you can't give your creatures some depth. There is also no notable trace of his sparkling dialogues which, coming from whom they come, can be accused with the worst criticism: ""any Hollywood brat could have written them."" The ""Tarantino touch"" appears sporadically (the arrival of Vivica A. Fox's daughter, or the ""big toe"" scene), but not at all with the force with which these types of findings dazzled in the past until they became a adjective. And as for the virguera direction, acclaimed as a style exercise, it is only brilliant at times (excellent the entrance of Lucy Liu and her minions to the dance hall with traveling to the rhythm of the music), foolishly violent (unforgivable for being QT the only director to whom the public understood and ""forgave"" his excessive violence in his other films) and with scenes of sword fights that in no way surpass those of ""Zatoichi"" or ""Hero"", for putting only two movie examples from the current billboard.
